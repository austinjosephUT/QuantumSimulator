# Quantum Simulator
 
Quantum Simulator is a Python library for helping model a multi-qubit gate system similar to that of IBM QX. 
With continued additions should be easier to look at visualizations and help aid students with understanding more about
the course CS309/PHY303 Quantum Computing-FRI at UT Austin taught by Dr. Brian La Cour and Dr. Noah Davis. 

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install cmath
pip install random
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install cmath
pip install numpy
pip install cmath
```

## Usage

```python
import numpy

#foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
#foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
#foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```


##Project Prompt
Using  your  favorite  programming  language,  write  a  quantum computer  simulator. 
Your  code  should  take  as  its  input  a  QASM  file,  such as that produced by the IBM Quantum Experience, and an integer number of shots. The software should compute the quantum state before measurement as a  vector  of  complex  numbers.   In  addition,  it  should  produce  the  number  ofcounts (out of the total number of shots) for each possible outcome.



##Modeling Noisy Gates

To model noisy gates. 

##Visualizations
```python
import matplotlib as plt
plt.show()
```
